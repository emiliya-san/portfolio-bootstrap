            <div class="text-block text">It all began with a list search on Ocado.
                The design of the website felt clumsy to me. I believed it could&apos;ve
                been improved. But how? To find out, I asked users about their
                website experience. In particular, I was focusing on:
                <ul class="dash text">
                    <li>findability;</li>
                    <li>discoverability;</li>
                    <li>usability of the multisearch input (the input itself, as well as buttons and text).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="text-block text second-text-block">
                <div class="h5 bold">What was I expecting to find out?</div>
                <ul class="dash text">
                    <li>why people use list search;</li>
                    <li>why they don&apos;t;</li>
                    <li>whether they have tried using it at all;</li>
                    <li>what doesn&apos;t work for them (anything they would expect the search to do that it doesn&apos;t);</li>
                    <li>how it is being used.</li>
                </ul>

                    explaining what is the interview going to be about, providing details
                    and describing what one needs to be aware of in advance. The email has
                    been sent to our internal community of volunteers.

                        Hi Guys!<br><br>
                        I&apos;m Emiliya, I&apos;m working with the UX community. We&apos;re looking for volunteers
                        to help test something on the Ocado website. It will be something to do with
                        searching and shopping.<br><br>
                        The session should take no more than 15 minutes and we plan to conduct them in
                        the Hatfield head office.<br><br>
                        If you are free on 12th of December between 11:00-12:00 or 15:00-16:00, please
                        sign into the form here. We will come back to you with an allocated time and
                        room location afterwards.<br><br>
                        We will be asking you to login to your Ocado account. If you&apos;re not comfortable
                        to login from my machine, please bring your own.<br><br>
                        Thanks,<br>Emiliya

                        I&apos;ve put together a script to give the customer a clear introduction and
                        help transition the conversation from greetings to the body of the interview.

                            Hi I'm Emiliya. I'm working in webshop OSP and I'm testing how people use
                            search on Ocado.<br><br>
                            Testing is supposed to take about 15 minutes, and the task will be based around
                            searching products you frequently buy, on the Ocado website.<br><br>
                            I want to encourage you to think out loud as much as possible: to say what you're
                            looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be really
                            helpful for us.<br>
                            If you have any questions of comments during the process, just ask me. If you need
                            to take a break at any point, just let me know.

                This is how I decided that I want to focus on the plain search instead.
